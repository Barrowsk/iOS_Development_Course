# iOS Development Course

I took Kenneth Jones's Udemy course, [SwiftUI 4 and Swift 5.7: iOS App Development for iOS 16](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/)! Here are all of the projects I created.

## Lord of the Rings Converter [Currency Converter]

This app lets users convert from one LOTR currency to another. To switch currencies, the user taps on either currency icon. The user can enter a number in either the left or right text field and the other will automatically update. There is an info button that pulls up a screen displaying exchange rates. 

#### Learning targets

## Jurrasic Park Apex Predators [Master Detail App]

## Breaking Bad Quotes [Networking]

In this app, users can randomly generate a quote from either "Breaking Bad" or "Better Call Saul". The app connects to the [breaking bad API](https://www.breakingbadapi.com/) (deprecated) to display a random quote and gather information about the character we are quoting. By tapping on the character photo, you can view details about this character.

#### Learning targets

- Networking
- Async/Await
- Computed Properties

*The breaking bad API is deprecated so the screenshots are of the XCode preview with sample data

## Pokedex 3 [Core Data App]

This app displays the first three generations of pokemon. We get data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and after opening the app for the first time, we store this information in core data. Users can tap on any pokemon to view some info about them as well as their stats. They can change the sprite from regular to shiny and they can favorite pokemon. Users are able to filter for favorite pokemon.
